EP2400-template
===============

This is a template code to implement a solution for the course project (EP2400 Network Algorithm) that I was a teaching assistant, while I am with KTH. The code is based on PeerSim (http://peersim.sourceforge.net/) of which I added the resource allocation components on top of the P2P simulation function (package peersim.EP2400.*). The detailed description of the project can be found in the file "ep2400-proj1-2012.pdf". The key learning from the project is how to design, develop, and evaluate a distributed solution based on gossip protocols.
